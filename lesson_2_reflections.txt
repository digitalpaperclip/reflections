Lesson 2 reflections

R.e.#1
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a .git-file in the current location.
You need to do it to create said file.

R.e.#2
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area offers a temporary storage for files to be committed.
This allows the user to select which files to commit, so not all files
have to be committed at once.

R.e.#3
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can upload only selected files to the staging area that are affected by
that one logical change.
