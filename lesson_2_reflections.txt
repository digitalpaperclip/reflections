Lesson 2 reflections

R.e.#1
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a .git-file in the current location.
You need to do it to create said file.

R.e.#2
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area offers a temporary storage for files to be committed.
This allows the user to select which files to commit, so not all files
have to be committed at once.
