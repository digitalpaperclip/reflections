R.e. #1
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This several benefits:
- Allows contributions by several people regardless of location
- Serves as a back up with no vulnerability to physical defects
- Open Source structure allows for contributions from strangers

R.e.#2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because updating automatically means that you don't really have control over which commits
or what content gets pushed on your local repository, since other people could have
updated the GitHub repository.

R.e.#3
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
- Forks
Used to copy public repositories that you don't have direct access to.
Credits the original author
- Clones
Used to copy repositories that you do have direct access to, e.g. between
your own repository on GitHub and locally or between a fork on your GitHup and
locally.
- Branches
Different Commit "families" inside of a repository. Used if you work on several
parts of a project at once, eg. an easy mode and a italian localization.
