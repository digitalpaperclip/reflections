R.e. #1
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This several benefits:
- Allows contributions by several people regardless of location
- Serves as a back up with no vulnerability to physical defects
- Open Source structure allows for contributions from strangers

R.e.#2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because updating automatically means that you don't really have control over which commits
or what content gets pushed on your local repository, since other people could have
updated the GitHub repository.
